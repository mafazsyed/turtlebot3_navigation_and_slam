# Turtlebot3 Autonomous Navigation and Mapping
Contains ROS package for Turtlebot3 autonomous navigation and live environment mapping.

The algorithm is based on a Finite State Machine (FSM) algorithm in C++ for advanced obstacle avoidance using LIDAR sensor data. It is rigorously tested in real-world conditions, achieving over 65% arena coverage within the first 90 seconds of operation while generating detailed environment maps through SLAM techniques.
